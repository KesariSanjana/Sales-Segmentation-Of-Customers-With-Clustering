# Sales-Segmentation-Of-Customers-With-Clustering
ABSTRACT

Now a days, data analysis plays a vital role in understanding or retrieving the required knowledge from the
data. In this project we are focusing on dealing with the Machine Learning application which is used to get
the structure of the data.
Clustering algorithms find the structure in the data so that elements of the same cluster or group are more
like each other than to those from different clusters. For this process to happen in our project we used the
K-MEANS algorithm which is an important algorithm in ML.
The algorithm functions in such a way that all the data points fall at similar clusters and segregate from the
other clusters. Data visualization is also performed for better results and understanding.
K-means clustering which is one of types of ML algorithms in real time applications like business, medicine,
image recognition, pattern recognition, climate, and information retrieval.
Since it is a very dense application to work on, we took a smaller portion of the applications to deal with the
sales of a business, which classifies the customers to increase the sales of a business.
